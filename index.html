        <em>Bottom Page for short description of each candidate</em>

        <p><strong>Welcome! </strong>Here is a list of candidates for you on the next page that you might 
            see if you live near me <em>(eden prairie)</em><br><br>(R)
        for republican <br> (D) for democratic farmer labor <em>democrat</em></p>

        <h2>Quick summary of Republicans and Democrats</h2> 
        <p>From my understanding, here are most Republican candidate's priorities</p>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Women's Rights</strong>
            Against Abortion <em>(some candidates have exceptions)</em> Supports adoption and against killing fetuses 
            <strong>Education</strong>
            Funding more towards private schools (less for public). Parents should decide what curriculums their children should learn in school
            <strong>Economy</strong> Less strict on taxes for small businesses. Help try to fight inflation (a different approach)
        </p>
            <p>Democrat candidate's priorities</p>
            <p>
            <strong>Women's Rights</strong> Pro-Abortion. Fund hospitals and allow abortion to be practiced
            <strong>Education</strong> Fund more money into public schools. More recourses for students and teachers
            <strong>Economy</strong> Help try to fight inflation (isn't working fully)<strong> Environment</strong> Clean environment
        </p>

        <p>There was this phrase someone said which I am going to paraphrase: "Economically I lean more republican, socially
            I lean more democrat"
